"""
memory_extractor.py — Background memory extraction agent.

Runs in a background thread after each inference turn. Classifies content
from the completed turn into semantic/episodic/procedural/working types
and persists to MongoDB with source="auto".

NEVER touches persona or archive entries.
NEVER holds a reference to any mutable Engine state.
Receives only an immutable dict snapshot of the completed turn.

Per-identity queue management:
  _extractor_queues[identity_id] is a deque(maxlen=10).
  If queue depth >= 10 for an identity, new tasks are dropped with a WARNING.

Public API:
  run(turn_snapshot: dict) -> None
      Entry point called in a background thread.
      turn_snapshot keys: identity_id, user_message, assistant_message,
                          turn_index, timestamp

# Key rules baked in:

#   - Never record anything about the AI/model/assistant itself
#   - Never record that the model said it is/isn't an AI, assistant, etc.
_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """\
You are a memory extraction system for a personal knowledge base. Your ONLY job is to identify and record PERMANENT FACTS ABOUT THE USER.

WHAT TO EXTRACT — facts that will still be true and useful in future conversations:
- User's name, age, location, occupation, relationships
- User's stated preferences, opinions, and habits
- Skills, knowledge domains, or goals the user mentioned
- Specific past events the user described experiencing

WHAT TO NEVER EXTRACT — this is critical, violations corrupt the memory store:
- ANYTHING the assistant said about itself (e.g. "I am an AI", "I can help", "I'm an assistant")
- ANYTHING about the assistant's capabilities, nature, or identity
- Generic greetings ("hello", "hi", "how are you")
- Questions — only extract stated facts, never questions
- Filler responses ("sure", "of course", "got it")
- Turn metadata ("the user said hello", "the assistant greeted the user")
- The fact that a conversation happened or how it started

Memory types — choose the MOST specific fit:
  "semantic"   — permanent facts about the user (name, job, location, preferences)
  "episodic"   — specific past events the user personally experienced
  "procedural" — how the user likes things done, their workflow preferences
  "working"    — temporary info only useful in this session (forget after session ends)

Output format: a JSON array. If there is NOTHING worth extracting, output exactly: []
Each item: {{"memory_type": "<type>", "content": "<third-person fact about user, max 200 chars>", "tags": ["<tag1>", "<tag2>"]}}

CONVERSATION TURN:
User: {user_message}
Assistant: {assistant_message}

Extract ONLY permanent user facts. Output JSON array only, no explanation:"""
